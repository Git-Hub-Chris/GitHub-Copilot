ehthumbs.db
Thumbs.db && Integration Plan Without API Keys
Add the Widget to the UI The widget is embedded using basic HTML and customization options via data-* attributes.
Handle Queries Locally All queries from the widget are processed directly in the backend without external API calls.
Process Widget Feedback Feedback and inputs from the widget dynamically influence superintelligence goals and actions.

Backend Code (Python)
This version avoids any external services and keeps everything in the local environment.

python
Copy code
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, Aer, execute
import logging

app = Flask(__name__)

# Set up logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

# Process widget queries locally
@app.route('/api/ask', methods=['POST'])
def process_query():
    data = request.json
    question = data.get('question', 'No question provided')

    # Log the question
    logging.info(f"Received query: {question}")

    # Process the query locally
    response = handle_local_query(question)
    
    return jsonify({"answer": response})

def handle_local_query(question):
    if "optimize" in question.lower():
        # Example optimization logic using Qiskit
        qc = QuantumCircuit(1)
        qc.h(0)
        qc.measure_all()
        simulator = Aer.get_backend('aer_simulator')
        result = execute(qc, simulator, shots=1000).result()
        counts = result.get_counts()
        return f"Optimization result: {counts}"
    elif "next step" in question.lower():
        return "The next step is recalibrating neural pathways."
    elif "fetch" in question.lower():
        return "Fetching internal data... Completed successfully!"
    else:
        return "I'm not sure how to respond to that yet. Can you rephrase?"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
Integration into Goal Hierarchy
python
Copy code
class GoalHierarchy:
    def __init__(self):
        self.goal_tree = {}

    def add_goal(self, goal, sub_goals):
        self.goal_tree[goal] = sub_goals

    def process_widget_feedback(self, feedback):
        # Use widget feedback to dynamically influence goals
        new_goal = f"Respond to widget feedback: {feedback}"
        self.add_goal(new_goal, ["Analyze feedback", "Adjust actions", "Validate results"])
        return f"Added goal: {new_goal}"

# Example usage:
goal_hierarchy = GoalHierarchy()
feedback = "Optimize pathways"
result = goal_hierarchy.process_widget_feedback(feedback)
print(result)
Key Points
No API Keys: All logic and interaction are processed locally.
Quantum Integration: Queries related to optimization use quantum computation (Qiskit).
Feedback-Driven Goals: The system dynamically updates its goal hierarchy based on widget inputs.
